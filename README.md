# Mathematics-for-ML

**Notes | Resources | Links**

The following are the topics I would be covering as I progress in the coming months:

- Linear Algebra Basics
- Calculus
- Probability
- Linear Algebra Advance

> ## Linear Algebra Basics

For Linear Algebra, I have referred to the 3Blue 1 Brown [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab), which has explained core concepts of linear algebra along with a visuals-first approach.

Topics covered in this include:

- Vectors
- Linear combinations, span, and basis vectors
- Linear Transformations
- Matrix multiplication
- 3D transformations
- Determinant & Matrices
- Eigen Vectors and Eigen Values
